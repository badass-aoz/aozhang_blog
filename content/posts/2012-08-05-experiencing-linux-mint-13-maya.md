**Finally** I made it to complete the installation of [Mint 13 with Cinnamon][1] and done a lot of configuration. 

I have to admit that Mint is quite easy to use for a CS newbie who wants to advance to Linux tech from Windows. However, there are still lots of stuff (and lots of fun too!) to do for Mint to work as you want. That said, I am going to post some of the problems I met and solutions (search, improve, and share) in the hope that I may save some efforts of the public and some of mine in case I may need to re-solve some.

Anyway, thanks to the development team of Mint!
