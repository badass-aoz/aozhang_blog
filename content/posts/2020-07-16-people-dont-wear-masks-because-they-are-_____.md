_People don&#8217;t wear masks because they are \_____._

What&#8217;s your answer? Quick, use your instinct.

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    because they are stupid?
  </li>
  <li>
    because they are selfish?
  </li>
  <li>
    because they are less educated?
  </li>
</ul>

I&#8217;ve been reading a book called _Mindwise_ which explains why we misunderstand each other. One important note is that we tend to translate another&#8217;s behavior directly into their intention, i.e. someone does something because they /want/ to do something. The translation often leads to bias and misunderstanding, more so if those people are strangers to us. To understand behaviors better, we need to zoom out and take the peripheral context into our interpretation. 

Back in January and February, Coronavirus broke out violently in China and I heard those scary stories about the death toll and strict lockdown measures from my parents back in China in real time. I&#8217;ve gone through H1N1 and SARS and could still recall when my school was locked down and every single one of my ~60 classmates got sick in less than a week. I knew the Covid situation was bad. I needed to wear a mask.

I didn&#8217;t wear a mask.

I didn&#8217;t wear a mask because I was afraid. I was afraid of my yellow Chinese skin and dark Chinese pupils along with the ostensible face mask would in combination yell to others &#8220;hey I&#8217;m a sick Chinese&#8221;. CDC and WHO were then still advocating against wearing masks because masks could make wearers more susceptible to infection. NYT was criticizing the Chinese Government&#8217;s infringement on basic human rights since the government required everyone to wear a mask. Moreover, stories were floating around about Asians got verbal or even physical abuses because of wearing masks, or simply because of being Asians.

I didn&#8217;t wear a mask because I didn&#8217;t want to look stupid for doing something CDC advocated against, or appear selfish for wandering on the streets while hiding my probably sick face behind a mask.

Now it&#8217;s July. History doesn&#8217;t repeat itself&#8211;it echos.

Are people not wearing masks more stupid/selfish than those who are? I don&#8217;t believe Los Angeles or Yakima county residents (high death toll right now) are statistically more stupid than Seattle residents (more stable infection rate), nor do I believe the formers are more selfish or less educated than the latter. 

Of course I&#8217;m not saying that we shouldn&#8217;t wear masks. To the contrary, I&#8217;d be more than happy to see the Washington government imposing some strict lockdown measures or enforcing mask wearing by more than a Tweet claiming that wearing masks was required. However, blaming without understanding context is not going to help much.

We are social animals. We look to other people for social norms to abide to. If no one in town is wearing a mask, you won&#8217;t wear a mask.

We are mammals. We do what&#8217;s easy. If masks can&#8217;t be found in the grocery store where you visit daily, it&#8217;s unlikely you&#8217;ll wear masks.

We are human. From evolution we by nature aren&#8217;t inclined to hurt other people. If there&#8217;s clear equivalence between not wearing masks and murders, we&#8217;d rather not kill strangers on the street.

&#8220;You can&#8217;t fight stupidity!&#8221; The wording is full of sound and fury. 

Signifying nothing.
