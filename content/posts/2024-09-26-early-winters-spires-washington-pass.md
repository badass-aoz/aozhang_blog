I climbed the Northwest Corner of North Early Winters Spire (NEWS) and Southwest Rib (Boving Variation) of South Early Winters Spire (SEWS) with friends on Sept 21-22. Those were two fun moderate routes with reasonable approach time in the iconic Liberty Bell group.



## Sept 20, 2024, NEWS, NW Corner {.wp-block-heading}

We parked at the Blue Lake Trailhead at around 8:40 on Friday (Sep 20, 2024). On our way there it was raining heavily in the Cascasdes. Unfortunately the rain didn’t stop at all when we were at the parking lot. At the time we parked, we saw other hikers/climbers sneaking into their cars and driving away. 

Not a good sign.

Alas, we started hiking in anyway. At least we can do identify the climbing base and do a reconnoissance of the climbing route the the future. Around 20 mins of leisure hiking, the rain reduced to a drizzle and finally halted to a full stop. It was still chilly and windy, but at least it gave us a bit of hope.

It was pretty straightforward to hike to the base of NEWS, as the climber trail was mostly marked. Once at the climbing base, there was a spur trail from the West face to a chimney feature. We racked up at the base and stash our unneeded gears closer to the gulley entrance. We didn&#8217;t bring trail runners in our climbing pack, and that turned out fine.<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">

I led all the pitches. I was able to link the first and second pitches. The first pitch featured a chimney with some awkward movements. Climbing outside the chimney and staying on the face would have been easier, but since I only placed a single pro way down below, I opted to climbing into the chimney and slinging around a chockstone in the chimney. Awkwardly, I got my helmet stuck while climbing out of the chimney. I couldn’t twist my head, and had to pull my head back and duck down to avoid the narrow part. Fun move! Once on the second pitch, I bushwacked to the belay station. Instead of directly going to the bottom of the third pitch hand crack, I belayed at a spacious flat ledge to reduce rope drag. 

While I was belaying my friend Li, it started flurry snow. The snow lasted for about a few minutes. I debated quite a bit internally if we should retreat, but when Li showed up at the belay, I decided to proceed anyway. The worst case? We abandon some gears and retreat. No big deal.

The third pitch started off by climbing around a corner. Once on top of it, I was standing nearby a tree and could transition to the hand crack by climbing a bit higher up. The hand crack was a cruiser, and then the challenge was climbing up the zigzag flakes. Some of the flakes featured nice hand jams, while other parts required some powerful layback and side pulls. Those pulls were made harder by the snow 20 minutes ago, which painted a thin layer of moisture on the granite surface. So I had to work extra hard to get my feet stick on the wall.<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">

Up onto pitch 5. Supertopo had it as “business starts right off belay”. It wasn’t joking. After a few secure hand jams and placed a #2 c4 camalot, I stuck my right arm into the crack and woah, I wasn’t going anywhere afterwards. The offwidth required sticking right arm deep into the crack with a fist jam, while smearing left foot on the rock surface, except there’s no good way to confidently do the smearing on the wet surface. After a few tries I gave up my efforts, along with my dignity of free climbing, and unclipped my two #4 cams from my harness. Alternatively I swung and stuck them into the offwidth crack and moved up for about 20 feet before I could finally free climb this crack again. The crack also took #3-#1 pretty well. My friend Li also had much fun top roping this crack, cheating his way and slipping now and then.<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">

The rest of the story was straightforward. I climbed up a slab (the official 5.7 grading felt right) and led up the rest 5.9s. After the offwidth, other 5.9 felt like cruiser, except a few committing moves occasionally. Once up the summit, we took a selfie and headed down.

It was a pretty cold day. Both of us were climbing in our down jackets and hard shells. Even with that I didn’t feel I had enough insolation for the weather. Finally at the summit we bathed in sunshine and enjoyed a bit of warmth.<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">

There were two ways to rap down the summit—the West face and the Chockston route (in the gulley). We were aiming for the West face rappel, but didn’t find it. The gulley rappel was pretty obvious though, so we took that one instead. The rappel would have been a rope stretcher for a 60m rope (single rope double strand), but since we had a 70m there’s no problem with the rappel. After rappelling three times we landed into the gulley. Coiling up the rope, walking to a lower anchor, and rapping another time got us to yet another flat surface in the gulley. And after one last rappel we were at the base, just slightly below our starting point.<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">

Since the plan was for me to climb SEWS the next day, we stashed the rope and gears at the base of SEWS SW rib overnight before the deproach.



## Sept 21, 2024, SEWS SW Rib (Boving Roof Variation) {.wp-block-heading}

My friend Alvin met me later that day and we camped in a nearby park. The next day drove to the Blue Lake Trailhead and started hiking around 8:20am. We reached the climbing base and experienced quite a lot of traffic on that route (it’s a Saturday with good weather). The approach was fairly fast given that I had stashed rope and gears at the climbing base the day before.<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">

<img decoding="async" src="http://wp.docker.localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/img_0563-1.jpg?w=768" alt="" class="wp-image-1654" /> <figcaption class="wp-element-caption">the best kind of approach: no backpack!</figcaption></figure> 

The climbing base was a Y shaped larch tree. When we were at the base at 9:20am there were already two other climbing parties ahead of us (later on we would find more parties behind us). It would be another hour before we could get on the wall. I’ve climbed this route before with the 10b finger crack variation in pitch 4, but part of the mission was to try out the Boving Roof variation. Meanwhile, a few weeks ago other friends rappelled off SEWS at night due to a delay caused by a [rescue mission][1] ahead of them. They didn&#8217;t find the last rappel anchor and had to leave a few gears on the wall, so part of our mission was to retrieve their rappel gears. 

Due to traffic jam, we didn&#8217;t link first two pitches. I led Pitch 1 and Alvin led pitch 2, combined pitch 3 and 4, and got us to the bottom of Boving Roofs. There were comments from Mountain Projects that there were loose blocks at the beginning, and they weren’t lying. Those blocks were microwave-oven sized (or larger), so pulling on them would definitely cause severe casualties. I manoeuvred my way carefully around those blocks, and followed a crack to the first roof. The first roof was half the size of the second roof, but pulling up the roof turned out harder for two reasons. First, I had to extend my first piece with a double length sling, or this would cause much rope drag. However, there’s a rock block right below the roof, so if I fall on this extended piece I would definitely deck. Second, the handhold on this move wasn’t good, and I had to reach my arm really into the roof rock and pull really hard to get myself onto it. I am 6&#8242;, and can imagine this move being significantly harder for smaller climbers. Once above the first roof, the second roof offered great hand jams for movement and protection, and there’s a nice horizontal ledge for toes to move to the corner of the second roof. Once at the corner, there was a sequence of committing moves to pull up around the roof into the corner/chimney behind the roof. This was easier given there were great handholds along the upper edge of the corner. I found having double #1 and triple #2 helpful, albeit a #3 could also be useful at times.<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">

I think triple #2 and double #1 was useful. I think I might have used a single #3 on the whole route.</figcaption></figure> 

I squeezed my way into the corner/chimney and setup the belay for Alvin. The belay was below the top of bear hug move, so I could observe climbers on the original route congratulating themselves after pulling up the bear hug move. Talking with them made my subsequent navigation really easy. Alvin led the next pitch by climbing up the corner and merging into the standard route of SW Rib ([pitch 5 per Mountain Project][2]).<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">

The rest of the climb was straightforward. Once at the summit, we started looking for [the newly established rappel anchor][3] for SEWS. The current description was pretty vague and I’ve left a comment on it. Be care of getting your rope stuck. It can be useful to take note of the GPS coordinates I took for the rap anchor (48.51126, -120.65597). After three raps we were able to get down to the East side of the spire, and took like 100ft of scrambling to get back to the climbing base of South Arete.

Overall I recommend the Boving Roof to anyone looking for a nice alpine adventure. <figure class="wp-block-image size-large">
