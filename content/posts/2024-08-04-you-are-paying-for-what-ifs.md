Poor souls, let me introduce you to the wonderful world of board/tabletop games!

Ever wonder how you can venture into a jungle and explore the ancient ruins, all on a tabletop? ([Lost Ruins of Arnak][1])

Maybe you are a sci-fi fan? How about building space imperium and fighting for supremacy of the universe? ([Twilight Imperium][2])

Hate colonialism? You might be interested in protecting island natives from invading European colonists as local spirits ([Spirit Island][3])

Too bland? No problem! What about laying tiles in artisan windows and score points for fancy patterns? ([Sagrada][4])

  
Feeling like playing solo? Conquer the land of mages and knights on your own ([Mage Knight][5])

Whatever your preference, there’s a game for you. According to Board Game Geek, the definitive guide website for hobby board games, [over five thousand games were published in 2023][6]. The global board game industry is estimated at around [25 billion in size and projects 11% annual growth for the next 4 years][7]. It shouldn’t come as a surprise that many board game hobbyist have large collections, sometimes numbering in the hundreds or more. Here’s [my collection][8] if you are interested.

Funnily enough, a big portion of these collection consist of unplayed or seldom-played games, wittily dubbed the “shelf of shame”. The term captures the guilt of _acquisition disorder_ well. We simply buy too many board games but don’t play them much, if at all. There have been recent effort to rebrand this to “_shelf of opportunity_” instead. Regardless, how do we end up here? Why are we purchasing those games that we will never get a chance to play?

I think it boils down to tricks of consumerism. Board games are sold via the various tricks:

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    <strong>The Pursuit of the Perfect Game:</strong> Somewhere in a corner of the world, there hides the game that&#8217;s just perfect for you. You must find it.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Kickstarter and Crowdfunding:</strong> Many board games are sold via Kickstarter or other crowdfunding platforms. After the campaign, some games never make it to retail. If you miss the crowdfunding campaign, you might miss the chance to play the game forever. The <em>fear of missing out</em> (FOMO) fuels impulse purchases. Kickstarter is especially tricky because purchases are made based on promises rather than reality. On the delivery date, it’s hit or miss whether the campaign fulfills its original promises.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Crowdfunding-only Promos:</strong> Even if some games make it to retail, there may be crowdfunding-only promos, such as special cards, miniatures, or scenario books, adding another layer of FOMO.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>The Cult of the New:</strong> You purchase a game from a retail store intending to play it on game night. But your friends bring games they like, and you have other games waiting to be played for months. New games quickly capture your attention, and the once shiny new game fades into oblivion.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>The Overhead of Playing:</strong> Maybe you can’t find the opportunity to play a game, and you’re fully aware of that. Board games take mental space and require effort to set up, tear down, gather friends, and learn new rules.
  </li>
</ul>

Despite those, you keep purchasing and expanding your collection. Why? Buying games is a way of engaging with your hobby. You feel like you’re doing something for the hobby, even if it’s not how it’s intended to be played.

Think about the rosy pictures game publishers paint: “the unique combat mechanism allows unlimited customization,” “rogue-like adventure game in a refreshing world setting,” or “casual family game with a twist.” They sell you a vision, not just a product. Often, the vision is enough, even if you don’t have time to play the game.

It all boils down to a lot of “what ifs.”

What if this game is the ultimate one I’ve been searching for?

The same applies to other types of acquisition disorder:

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    I bought this video game but don’t have time to play it.
  </li>
  <li>
    I bought this book, and one day I’ll read it.
  </li>
</ul>

It’s okay to spend your money on all those what-ifs.

After all, you won’t play all those games.
