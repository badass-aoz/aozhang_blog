There are two ways of explaining why people do what they do: dispositional and situational. The former explains people behavior based on the perceived intrinsic traits of observant (he&#8217;s born evil), whilst the latter explains it based on the observant&#8217;s situation (he&#8217;s having a bad day). The Fundamental Attribution Error theory states that people tend to overlook situational factors behind others&#8217; behavior while overemphasize dispositional factors.

The term was coined by Lee Ross from his experiment in Stanford. Students were randomly divided into two groups, the Questioners and the Contestants. The former were asked to come up with difficult trivia questions such as &#8220;when was one of Virginia Woolf&#8217;s book got published&#8221;, and the Contestants were to answer those questions. As expected, the Contestants could not answer most of those questions. Afterwards, observers of the experiment were asked if the Questioners and the Contestants were smarter than an average Stanford student. It turned out the Questioners were thought to be smarter whist the Contestants were thought to be less smart, despite that those two groups were divided randomly and that&#8217;s known to the observers. Apparently the observers didn&#8217;t consider much that the Questioners had an advantage as the ones who generated questions.

I believe the fundamental cause of the error is the readiness of using a set of &#8220;traits&#8221; to explain others behavior, and the difficulty of analyzing a behavior on per-case basis by doing investigation and gathering details. Human brains love to categorize, including human traits. If we can generalize other human using those traits, it makes it very efficient to remember experience and predict future behaviors, despite that those memories are likely partial, and those predictions erroneous.

There&#8217;s also one distinctive difference between how one perceive others and themselves, which is that the former tended to be more dispositional while the latter more situational. One reason is the lack of visibility into others&#8217; thought process. For example, recently an Facebook employee committed suicide in the office. While it&#8217;s easy to call him a coward (dispositional), it takes more energy to dig up the contextual story, that his job security was affected due to visa issues and management (according to rumors), and it&#8217;s impossible to think inside his mind, simply because he&#8217;s dead. RIP.

Be empathetic. Don&#8217;t judge.
