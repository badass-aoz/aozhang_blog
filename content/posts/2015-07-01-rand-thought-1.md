You said you wanted to come to a big company to improve your skill, but now you are losing momentum.

You said you would make progress every single day, but now you get numb and got satisfied with what you have now.

You said you sought a reclusive life after having enough money, but now you are missing the way.

You said you would forever be yourself no matter what, but you are no longer the person I used to know.

可惜流年，忧愁风雨，树犹如此！

Life is always going on. May I never stop being myself.
