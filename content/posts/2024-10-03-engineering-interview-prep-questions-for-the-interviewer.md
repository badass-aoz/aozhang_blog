So you’ve aced the interview and the interviewer was visibly happy about your performance. Here comes the last part of the interview.

Interviewer: “Now it’s your time. Any question for me?”

Sure you can probably spin something up on the spot, but you are deciding whether you are going to (typically) spend the next few years of your precious career at a company, and before you make that decision, you are offered an opportunity to learn about it from an internal perspective. Why squander away that opportunity due to sheer unpreparedness?

I&#8217;ve compiled a list of my favorite questions. Take them with a grain of salt, and feel free to share your own.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">To recruiters:</span>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
  <p>
    Due diligence about the job, including but not limited to: compensation; location; RTO policy; org structure; XFN teams; interview loop steps; etc.
  </p>
</blockquote>

Be aware that the recruiter may not know much about the details of your role, especially for smaller departments/orgs, because recruiters there tend to be responsible for hiring for multiple departments/orgs and don&#8217;t have deep context for all of them. The knowledge gap should be filled in by an interview conducted by the hiring manager instead.



<span style="text-decoration: underline">To the hiring manager:</span>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
  <p>
    What’s your ideal target candidate profile? What kind of person will be most useful for the team?
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
  <p>
    What’s the org structure like? Which teams do I get to work with frequently?
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
  <p>
    What are your expectations for the first 90 days?
  </p>
</blockquote>

Be careful! If I were the hiring manager, I&#8217;d 100% ask the question back. You better have prepared your own answer to this question.



<span style="text-decoration: underline">To future peers:</span>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
  <p>
    What are the major technical challenges in the team?
  </p>
</blockquote>

Hopefully you have done your reconnaissance beforehand and have listened carefully during the interviewer&#8217;s intro (if they have one), so you have some context.



<span style="text-decoration: underline">For an IC role:</span>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
  <p>
    Where do you see the new role fit in the team&#8217;s existing workstreams?
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
  <p>
    You mentioned during the intro that you worked on project X. Can you elaborate this?
  </p>
</blockquote>

I recommend asking this sparingly unless you are truly interested in this project. I personally find it more revealing to ask about something else, such as the work culture.



<span style="text-decoration: underline">For an EM role:</span>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
  <p>
    How do you do effective planning?
  </p>
</blockquote>

Planning can be chaotic and is rarely done effectively. I have gone through and driven many many planning sessions and don&#8217;t know a single one perfect planning. Hence the answer to this question can be indicative of the management style. For example, centralized planning can imply a top-down and heavily structure management philosophy.

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
  <p>
    What’s the part of the culture that really stood out to you?
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
  <p>
    How much upward reporting do you need to do? Do you feel are were getting value out of this?
  </p>
</blockquote>

This question helps me understand the job I&#8217;m applying for because in a leadership role, we can be placed in situations where our direct/skip managers don&#8217;t have the expertise that we have. As an example, a CISO (Chief Information Security Officer) can report a CEO even though the CEO himself is not a security expert. Here, upward reporting becomes critical for us to do our job effectively.



<span style="text-decoration: underline">For a startup:</span>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
  <p>
    (to ask a startup) How does your runway look like? What’s your plan for IPO? ARR? Plan for another round of funding?
  </p>
</blockquote>

Startup selection warrants a separate discussion, and I am by no means an expert here. I am putting this question here for a placeholder. Obviously YMMV depending on how much the recruiter is instructed to disclose.

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
  <p>
    What’s your biggest business challenge at this point in time?
  </p>
</blockquote>



<span style="text-decoration: underline">Misc questions:</span>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
  <p>
    How do you like the performance review process?
  </p>
</blockquote>

For most people including me, getting recognized for our work is a key to job satisfaction. Hence it&#8217;s import to understand how the current employee feel towards the performance review process.



<span style="text-decoration: underline">Meh questions</span>:

Here are some questions that I love as an interviewer because they give me a chance to sell the company, but on the candidate side, I don’t find them valuable.

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
  <p>
    You’ve been here for X years. That’s long time by tech tenure standard. What’s keeping you here for so long?
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
  <p>
    What’s your favorite thing about working at Y?
  </p>
</blockquote>



<span style="text-decoration: underline">Questions to avoid</span>:

Questions asked to interviewers are not meant to be considered during assessment. It helps the candidate to get genuine answers. However, it’s better to be considerate and careful with what you truly ask. Moreover, some questions may not even yield insights if framed badly. Here are some examples:

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
  <p>
    (interviewing a startup) How’s the work-life balance?
  </p>
</blockquote>

I&#8217;ve heard this question asked once in a startup. Even though I didn&#8217;t include it in my assessment, I found it counter-intuitive that the candidate was interviewing for a role in startups and meanwhile cared about WLB.

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
  <p>
    (interviewing a big corp) How do you find the bureaucracy in your org?
  </p>
</blockquote>

I&#8217;ve heard this question asked a few times while at a big corp. This is not a good question because the question is fairly vague, and also some of the not-so-transparent interviewers may not feel they have built enough trust during the mere 45/60min interview to give the candidate a frank answer. Alternatively, this question can be framed around how flat the org structure is, or how much reporting/process overhead there is.

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
  <p>
    What is the employee turnover rate?
  </p>
</blockquote>

This is something that you can get a good feeling about by browsing through LinkedIn profiles.
