The book began with the David and Goliath story from Bible. The main idea was that underdogs like David could succeed at battling giants like Goliath if those underdogs realize utilizes their comparative advantages in a creative way. In the case of David and Goliath, David didn&#8217;t follow the convention of wearing heavy armors and fighting a close combat with brute force; instead, he used slings and stones to knock Goliath unconscious and decapitated him. The author carried on by giving examples of how a Redwood football team won a national championship through a strong defense strategy, despite that its members were not top-notch football players. The author then explained how small countries beat off big countries&#8217; invasion via guerrilla warfare, in which soldiers from weaker countries maximized the advantage of being local and more determined.

The book went less consistent then. It gave examples of why being a small fish in big ponds may not be better than being a big fish in a small pond, in the context of choosing graduate school. I can sort of see the relation between this story and the underdog success philosophy here. However, the book went on talking about a physician who was brave enough to break some shallow doctor ethics to achieve real benefits for patients. Eye rolling. This is a great note for dialectic methods, but may not strongly support the book&#8217;s starting point. Then the book introduced inverse U curve, which essentially meant that in some cases neither too much nor too little were ideal.

Well, that sounds about right.
