I came across this book from Zuck&#8217;s book recommendation list, and have been enjoying reading the first two chapters so far.

The first two chapters talked about the physical evolution of _Homo sapiens_ (the wise man), and its unique ability to talk about fiction and the consequences. _Homo sapiens_ did not stand out from other species of animals until recently. One physical characteristic of _sapiens_ is its large brain volume, which enabled it to think more intellectually. However, it was hard to tell if that was a blessing or cursing at the ancient savannah age, because a larger brain means more energy is needed to sustain it, whereas those energy could have been diverted to develop strong muscle. From the better side, large brains enabled _sapiens_ to build tools, such as stone arrows and axes. One quite interesting theory was that _Homo _were talented marrow hunters, because only _Homos_ could use their stone tools to crack open bones and suck marrow, possibly from the carrions of larger animals&#8217; game.

Another interesting fact is that _sapiens_ were adapted to stand on two legs, which limited their pelvis sizes, inevitably making them smaller. As a result, females were having a hard time to give birth to new borns. By natural selection, those females giving birth prematurely, thus having smaller infants, could give birth more easily, so humans ended up being born prematurely, as compared to other animals. A kitten may live independently when it was still several-week-old, but human toddlers are helpless for several years, if not dozens. This makes it hard for a mom to raise a child by herself&#8211;a tribe/band&#8217;s resources may be needed to raise a single child, thus those who have better social skills survived.

By the way, did I mention that _Homo sapiens_ were not the first _Homo _to stand on two legs? _Homo erectus_ were. Strictly speaking, we are not the only human species that ever existed, but the only surviving human species. Other species existed too, such as Neanderthals. There are two theories of why we were the only surviving species. One was that we drove all other species into extinction; the other was that they got mixed into our species through mutual breeding. While the latter being politically incorrect (because it suggests different races are actually genetically different), I was more interested in why _sapiens_ won over other species. The ability of our language to describe fiction was the answer. We can describe abstract things, such as &#8220;God&#8221;, &#8220;faith&#8221;, and &#8220;patriotism&#8221;. Those provides a way of cooperation between a large group. In a small group&#8211;a group less the size of magical number 150&#8211;members are able to cooperate through intimate relationship, through gossips and rumors. Yes in a large group, say a middle sized Chinese city of one million people, it is impossible to know all other 999,999 people intimately, yet we are still able to live together and function as a city. The basis was a common acknowledgement of fiction, in this case, a sense of a country, of us being in a city that we need to protect and develop. This sense only exists in human imagination, and could only be developed upon a genome basis.
