It&#8217;s been humbling 3.5 months during my recent job hunt. I finally landed a job, and this is what I learned about interviews from a candidate&#8217;s experience.

## My Background {.wp-block-heading}

I brought 9 years of experience: 8 at a FAANG company and 1 at a Series D startup. After the startup&#8217;s acquisition, I took a break before job hunting. I focused mainly on Engineering Manager (EM) and Tech Lead Manager (TLM) roles in security, with one exception.

## Quick Stats {.wp-block-heading}

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    Applied to <strong>~60</strong> roles (sometimes multiple in the same company)
  </li>
  <li>
    Got phone screens/recruiter calls from <strong>~11</strong> companies
  </li>
  <li>
    Completed full loops with <strong>6</strong> companies
  </li>
  <li>
    Received <strong>2</strong> offers: one TLM, one EM
  </li>
</ul>

## Key Learnings {.wp-block-heading}

### Company Expectations Vary Dramatically {.wp-block-heading}

I encountered vastly different emphases on:

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    Technology: from securing hundreds of diverse tech stacks to focusing on one product&#8217;s privacy
  </li>
  <li>
    People: heavy focus on supporting people versus managing projects
  </li>
  <li>
    Process: operating in hyper-chaotic versus structured environments
  </li>
</ul>

Interview structures also varied wildly. Some memorable examples:

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    An Identity Access & Management technical interview that never touched on IAM topics
  </li>
  <li>
    A director role requiring purely technical assessment versus a line manager role with no technical questions
  </li>
  <li>
    A 45-minute interview where the interviewer asked questions for 10 minutes, then flipped to Q&A &#8211; not because I failed, but because they valued hearing my questions more
  </li>
  <li>
    A technical interview where the interviewer decided to grill me on behaviors for 30 minutes on a whim
  </li>
</ul>

Unfortunately, I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s a tried-and-true solution to any of the above.

### Question Standard Processes {.wp-block-heading}

Don&#8217;t take mature organizations&#8217; processes for granted. When asked about basics like &#8220;Why require two written feedbacks before a performance improvement plan?&#8221; avoid answers like &#8220;That&#8217;s Google&#8217;s process.&#8221; Instead, explain the reasoning behind these practices and add your perspective.

### Accept the Role of Luck {.wp-block-heading}

Preparation helps, but external factors matter. I once had an interviewer who seemed exhausted and barely engaged with my answers. I had to actively work to regain their attention. This eventually didn&#8217;t work out. In another case, my example of adapting to a report&#8217;s communication style was interpreted as lacking opinion &#8211; the opposite of my intended demonstration of communication insight. Sometimes the dice just roll against you.

### Stay Resilient {.wp-block-heading}

The process gets tough. One day I felt utterly frustrated, but posts about the ongoing Israel-Arab conflicts popped into my Facebook newsfeed, so I got to remind myself how fortunate I was. This perspective helped me maintain resilience.

### Adapt Beyond STAR {.wp-block-heading}

The standard STAR framework (Situation, Task, Action, Result) has limitations:

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    Add Learning: Include what you&#8217;d improve. One interviewer expected this after nearly every answer. I told them something that I was really proud of and couldn&#8217;t think of something that could have been done better. Later on the recruiter relayed their feedbacks that I couldn&#8217;t step back and introspect the situation.
  </li>
  <li>
    Handle Philosophy: STAR struggles with abstract questions like &#8220;how do you build a team&#8221;. What worked for me well was to review a book about management such as ones by Will Larson or Camille Fournier and ensure you talk through frameworks with your own examples.
  </li>
  <li>
    Manage Complex Stories: Not all stories has a final <em>Result</em> after an <em>Action</em>. I had a conflict resolution story with multiple twists (&#8220;STARSTARARAR&#8221;). Those are great for lunch breaks, but too long for interviews. I learned to cobble segments (&#8220;STTAAARRRR&#8221;) even though they weren&#8217;t in chronological order. This was against my habit of story telling but I just had to do it.
  </li>
</ul>

### Bridge Domain Knowledge Gaps {.wp-block-heading}

In specialist roles like security, prepare for interviewers unfamiliar with your field&#8217;s nuances. Example: I believe security professionals are less &#8220;_fungible_&#8221; than software engineers, because security domain can get really niche and there are less qualified security experts on the market than software engineers. However, I got flagged by a software engineering manager interviewer, because they believed it&#8217;s poor judgement for me to hire a specialized security expert who&#8217;s not well-rounded. Moreover, in the full interview loop for this role as a senior security engineering manager, I wasn&#8217;t asked a single security question.

### Value Connections {.wp-block-heading}

Network matters: 5 of my 6 full interviews came through referrals. My highest-level opportunities (both at director level) came from knowing the hiring manager. I ultimately accepted an offer from my former employer of 8 years. Much blessing from my ex-colleagues as a boomerang <3 

### Diversify Examples {.wp-block-heading}

While one complex situation might demonstrate multiple skills (conflict resolution, empathy, backbone), prepare various examples. Reusing the same story can suggest limited experience.

### Prepare Smart {.wp-block-heading}

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    Do mock interviews &#8211; even with 500 interviews under my belt, I learned new perspectives
  </li>
  <li>
    Create a concise cheatsheet with a table of contents &#8211; long versions prove impractical mid-interview
  </li>
</ul><figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">

## Aspiration {.wp-block-heading}

It&#8217;s been a truly humbling experience. I&#8217;ve got into a lot of self-doubt during the process, and I feel fortunate to land on a good opportunity again. In the future, I aspire to either have the opportunity find me, or be my own employer. 

Never do I want to go through the same toil. And I wish you don&#8217;t have to either.
