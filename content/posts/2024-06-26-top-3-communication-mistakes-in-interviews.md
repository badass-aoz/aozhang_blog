_**Not answering the interviewer’s question**_

Remember? The interviewer asked you a question and you didn’t know the answer, so you danced around it and rambled about other topics with lots of made-up enthusiasm.

Remember? You were too excited for a question because you had loads of tales to tell. You started elaborating the prehistory of the topic, the gossips you’ve heard in micro-kitchen, and the funny story that came along the

The interviewer’s face was twitching.

You knew what’s going through the interviewer’s mind:

“Just answer my f**king question!”

It’s too late. You wasted too much time of the interview already, and you were deep in a fascinating (albeit irrelevant) story/argument.

I was obviously exaggerating, but…why not just answer the question at the beginning?

It’s way better to admit ignorance than dancing around to distract the interviewer. It would show your candidness, and save both you and the interviewer time.

It’s also better to just say “there are a lot of preludes to this story. I’ll supply context if anything is unclear. Please feel free to interrupt me.” instead of elaborating a long thread of context before actually answering the question.



_**Rambling non-stop**_

“I’ll pause here. Any question?”

I smile whenever a candidate says that. It shows respect and confidence.

Roughly, I have seen 1/3 candidates rambling too much, 1/3 candidates speaking half a sentence (and I had to squeeze out the other half), and the rest 1/3 somewhere in between. And generally speaking, candidates with the following background tend to talk more:

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    worked in managerial roles
  </li>
  <li>
    worked in consulting industry
  </li>
  <li>
    had sheer decades of experience
  </li>
</ul>

The key here is not about talking too much. It’s about rambling and not giving the interviewer opportunities to interject. It’s cool to talk non-stop about all the cool projects that you have done, but please, give it a pause for the interviewer to ask questions. Keep in mind, a good interviewer can always forcibly jump in and catch you off guard. Hence, don’t give away the flow of your interview—grasp it in your hand.



_**Assuming without clarification**_

“In the system you design, make the infra highly scalable.”

“Tell me about a time when you had to make a decision fast and live with the consequence.”

How do you mean, my dear interviewer?

Sometimes the interviewer may be caught up in some lingering context elsewhere so they aren’t aware of the vagueness in their questions, whereas at some other times the interviewer can intentionally give a vague question so they can gauge your ability in clarifying vagueness.

Are they evil?

Not really. We engineers deal with vagueness all the time. It’s part of our job to dispel vagueness and design with clarity. Just as you would with your favorite product manager, ask your interviewer what they exactly meant.

“Scalable? What QPS are you targeting?”

“Fast decision? Are you trying to get signals on creative thinking or something else?”

When in doubt, ask.
