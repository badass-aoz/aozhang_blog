This is a pretty classic story by Oscar Wilde. The plot of the story was well-known: a handsome young man Dorian Gray got his portrait painted and fell in love with it. He prayed that his portrait would grow old while he would remain young forever. The pray came true. Dorian Gray got seduced by Lord Henry and became demoralized. He broke a girl&#8217;s heart who later committed suicide, killed the painter who also used to be Gray&#8217;s good friend, squandered his life and fortune, etc.. While Gray remained young and beautiful, his portrait aged and turned monstrous. In the end, Gray tried to destroy the portrait so no one could find out the secret by stabbing into the portrait, but ended up stabbing into his own chest. The portrait recovered to its original form, while Gray took the rugged and evil look

Since I knew the plot before reading it thoroughly, I didn&#8217;t find the plot much intriguing. However, I had much joy hearing all the quotes from Lord Henry, the antagonist. Every time I heard stories about him I abhor him, but then I heard him talking and could no longer hold my abhorrence. Wilde was known for all the golden quotes he made, and reading those quotes with context was more enjoyable than reading them along.

Some of my favorite quotes from the book included:

_“Nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing.”_

_“The only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it.”_

_“Never marry at all, Dorian. Men marry because they are tired, women, because they are curious: both are disappointed.”_

_“Laughter is not at all a bad beginning for a friendship, and it is by far the best ending for one.”_

_“Whenever a man does a thoroughly stupid thing, it is always from the noblest motives.”_

_“We women, as some one says, love with our ears, just as you men love with your eyes&#8230;”_

_“When a woman marries again, it is because she detested her first husband. When a man marries again, it is because he adored his first wife. Women try their luck; men risk theirs.”_
