A little bit about myself: I’ve spent 10 years in the security industry and hiring has always been my passion. I’ve conducted over 500 interviews in both FAANG and startup environments, was part of hiring committees for my team and other teams, and built hiring pipelines for specialist roles. Here I’m creating a series for security engineering interview preparation, in the hope that it can help you to prepare better for interviews.

My focus has been product security, and the general intersection between security engineering and software engineering. Hence the guide may not be completely relevant in case you are in other security disciplines, such as detection & response (IDR), or compliance & regulation (PRC), etc. However, I hope it still provides a general outline for how you can prepare for those interviews.

At the very high level, security interviews are used to gauge signals in two main aspects:

<ol class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    technical competency: <ol class="wp-block-list">
      <li>
        bug finding skill
      </li>
      <li>
        coding skill
      </li>
      <li>
        design skill
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    “people” competency: <ol class="wp-block-list">
      <li>
        culture fit
      </li>
      <li>
        project leadership
      </li>
      <li>
        people management (for a managerial role)
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

In this series, I am breaking a full interview loop into small pieces as outlined above. Each item will have links updated once they are ready.
