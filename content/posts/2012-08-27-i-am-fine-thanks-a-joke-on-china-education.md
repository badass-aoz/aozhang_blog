Long time no blog! 🙂

_This post is not intended to be anything serious, as it is labeled as a &#8220;scribble&#8221;, but hopefully, readers may think a little on the education of China._

Recently, I heard a joke: <span style="font-size:large;">a Chinese student was driving in the US; suddenly he fell off a cliff and got badly injured. Fortunately, there came a policeman, who said:&#8221;How are you?&#8221; Without thinking, the student responded:&#8221; I am fine, thank you!&#8221; So the policeman left, and the poor student soon died because of loss of too much blood.</span>

This joke may not make any sense to a native speaker, but probably many English learners in China (and maybe in other countries as well) may find it funny: in junior high schools, Chinese students, me included, were required to learn and recite a list of (rigid) daily English conversation. In this list, there was a typical one&#8211;as you may guess:  
&nbsp; &#8211;How are you?  
&nbsp; &#8211;I am fine, thanks/thank you, and you?  
&#8230;  
As a result, it is sometimes amusing to greet a Chinese, &#8220;How are you?&#8221;&#8211;you can expect the response.

Teaching style of other classes is usually non-different. I graduated from a stereotypical senior high school, which is a so-called 省级示范学校 (Province-level Exemplar School). The head of my class teaches physics. One of his motto was &#8220;多做题，做难题，规范做题！&#8221;(&#8220;Do more exercise, solve difficult questions, and answer in a standard way!&#8221;). Under his instructions, my class always got better physics grades than any other classes did, but are those differences really worth the effort?&nbsp;[No problem should ever have to be solved twice][1], and study is neither all about doing exercises, nor memorizing &#8220;I&#8217;m fine, thanks&#8221;.&nbsp;Study ought to be fun, and contents ought to be useful.
