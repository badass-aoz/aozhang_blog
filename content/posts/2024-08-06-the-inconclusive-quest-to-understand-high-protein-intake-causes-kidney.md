I’ve always been obsessed with living a long and healthy life, hence I care a lot about nutrition. A common belief about nutrition is that high protein intake can damage one’s kidney function, but I’ve heard very conflicting views on this topic, so I set out for brief quest for the truth. I want to read about clinical trials and epidemiology statistics. Those are what’s possibly closest to truths.

Unfortunately, in the middle of the process I realized that this is too big of a pill for me to swallow. Further more, the result, as with lots of other nutritional biochemistry studies, is inconclusive. Thus, I’ll shamefully dump some of my research and move on with my life.

Understanding the kidneys’ role in protein processing is a good starting point. Proteins are essential for health, serving as the building blocks for tissues, aiding in muscle repair and growth, and supporting enzyme and hormone production. They also play a role in immune function, fluid balance, and energy provision.

The kidneys maintain health by filtering waste products and excess substances from the blood, which are then excreted as urine. They regulate blood pressure, electrolyte balance, and red blood cell production.

In terms of protein processing, the kidneys filter waste products from protein metabolism. Dietary proteins are broken down into amino acids, which the body uses for tissue repair and enzyme production. The byproducts, such as urea and creatinine, are filtered by the kidneys and excreted in urine.

Urea and creatinine, both byproducts of protein metabolism, are filtered by the kidneys through a process called glomerular filtration. Blood enters the kidneys through the renal arteries and flows into the glomeruli, which are tiny networks of capillaries. Here, blood pressure forces water and small molecules, including urea and creatinine, through the walls of the capillaries and into the Bowman&#8217;s capsule, forming a filtrate. This filtrate then travels through the renal tubules, where necessary nutrients and water are reabsorbed back into the bloodstream. The remaining waste products, including urea and creatinine, continue down the tubules, eventually being excreted as urine.

While the kidneys efficiently handle these waste products, extremely high protein intake can increase their workload. However, in healthy individuals without pre-existing kidney conditions, the kidneys can generally manage this demand without adverse effects.

**Increased Kidney Workload**:

</ol>

• **Argument**: High protein intake increases the workload on the kidneys due to more waste products like urea and creatinine.

• **Counter**: Although protein metabolism produces more waste, healthy kidneys can efficiently handle this increased workload. In individuals with normal kidney function, high protein intake does not cause kidney damage or a decline in kidney function. The kidneys can adapt to varying protein levels, though the upper limit is not well-defined.

**Risk of Kidney Stones**:

<ol start="2" class="wp-block-list">
</ol>

• **Argument**: High protein diets can lead to kidney stones by increasing calcium and oxalate excretion.

• **Counter**: The relationship between protein intake and kidney stones depends on hydration, diet, and genetic factors. Adequate hydration and a balanced diet can reduce the risk of kidney stones, even with higher protein intake. Not all proteins have the same effect; animal proteins may impact differently than plant proteins.

**Glomerular Hyperfiltration**:

<ol start="3" class="wp-block-list">
</ol>

• **Argument**: High protein intake causes glomerular hyperfiltration, potentially leading to kidney damage over time.

• **Counter**: Glomerular hyperfiltration is a normal adaptive response to increased protein intake and does not necessarily indicate damage. Long-term studies have not shown a direct link between high protein diets and chronic kidney disease in healthy individuals, demonstrating the kidneys’ ability to adapt.

**Increased Proteinuria**:

<ol start="4" class="wp-block-list">
</ol>

• **Argument**: High protein diets can cause proteinuria (protein in urine), a marker of kidney damage.

• **Counter**: Mild proteinuria from high protein intake is typically benign and temporary in healthy individuals, resolving once protein levels normalize. Persistent proteinuria is more often related to underlying kidney disease rather than diet, so monitoring and medical evaluation are important for accurate assessment.

In summary, we just don’t know.



Onto the one single topic that I wanted to dig more into:

The recommendation of 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day is provided by the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which are developed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). From there, I identified this publications where this number might have from:

**Meta-analysis of nitrogen balance studies for estimating protein requirements in healthy adults (2003)**

This paper analyzes nitrogen balance data from 19 studies involving 235 individuals to update protein intake recommendations for healthy adults. It concludes that the estimated average requirement (EAR) for dietary protein is 105 mg of nitrogen per kilogram of body weight per day, equivalent to 0.65 g of good-quality protein per kilogram per day. The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) is set at 132 mg of nitrogen per kilogram per day, or 0.83 g of protein per kilogram per day, to meet the needs of nearly all individuals. The study finds that individual protein requirements follow a log-normal distribution and do not significantly differ based on factors such as climate, age, sex, or dietary protein source, though women may have slightly lower needs than men.

Limitations:

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    The paper also acknowledges the limitations of the nitrogen balance method, such as measurement errors and individual variability

    Additional limitations were later on raised, and some focused on ill or traumatized patients. Here are some publications to my interest

</ul>

**Nitrogen Balance at the Recommended Dietary Allowance for Protein in Minimally Active Male Vegans (2023)**

This paper discusses the (not-so) special case of vegetarian protein intake, and concluded that consumption of 0.8g/kg body weight isn’t sufficient for vegetarian, due to the amino acid profile of plant protein. Plant protein have different amino acid profile from animal protein. This is of importance because 9 out of 20 amino acid that human need could only be taken externally and not synthesized.

There are more evidence that this amount is not sufficient:

**Dietary protein adequacy and lower body versus whole body resistive training in older humans (2002)**

This study assessed the impact of RDA amount of protein intake to older people skeletal mass, and found that test subjects, independent of doing resistive training or not, lost muscle mass. This doesn’t mean that the experiment isn’t flawless:

<ol class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    small sample size: 29 total test subjects just isn’t enough
  </li>
  <li>
    small observation period: 12 weeks might not be long enough for observation
  </li>
  <li>
    protein are inherently complex: protein is more complex than carbohydrate or fat, and it’s much harder to study in a controlled environment
  </li>
</ol>

## Conclusion {.wp-block-heading}

I think it’s highly likely that we just won’t have the answer anytime soon, if the answer exists at all. However, it can be possible that we may have personalized tests that will recommend the ideal protein intake.
