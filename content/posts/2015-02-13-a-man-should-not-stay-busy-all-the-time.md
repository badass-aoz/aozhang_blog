A man should not stay busy all the time.

From time to time, he should be able to jump out from what he has been doing to have a broader view on his life and career. It is rather hard to have an open mind when it is occupied with labor, sometimes bothersome.

Recall the story of a young man and a monk. A young man, burned by his passion for high achievement but frustrated for failing all the time, consulted with a monk. Instead of answering the young man&#8217;s confusion directly, the monk invited him to sit down:&#8221;Would you like some tea?&#8221; &#8220;Yes please&#8221;, said the young man, a bit absentmindedly. The monk smiled, and started pouring the tea into a cup. Quickly, the tea filled in the cup and began to overflow, yet the monk didn&#8217;t stop pouring. &#8220;Wait! Wait!&#8221;, the young man exclaimed, feeling rather agitated and surprised&#8211;anyway, how could this monk be so careless. The monk, still smiling, said in a thoughtful tone:&#8221;I could not fill in the cup if it is already full. Similarly, if your mind is filled with labor, ambition and frustration,&nbsp; how can you listen to others? How can you differentiate the sound of your inner mind from noises?&#8221; Lost in thought, the young man remained silent.
