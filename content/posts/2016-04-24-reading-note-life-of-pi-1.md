Having just finished reading half of the book _LIfe of Pi_, I am writing some random notes (I hope to force myself to scribble something other than codes every now and then):

  It was a quite an interesting read. I wouldn&#8217;t say it was a great book, something at the same level as say, <i>War and Peace</i>, but for casual book reapers it is a good appetizer. Other than the well known plot of the book, famed by its movie, about an Indian guy managed to coexist with an adult Bengal tiger after a ship wrack on the Pacific ocean, another pearl from the book is the author&#8217;s control of the language, straightforward and humorous. He never tried to decorate profusely some intricate philosophy of  religion, but each word conveyed some meaning that was really easy to grasp.

  Talking about humor, one scene I liked was when the priests (or someone equivalent in other religions) of Christianity/Muslim/Hinduism caught the boy Pi while he was on a walk with his parents. All of the priests thought Pi was a pious worshipper of his own religion, never realizing that he actually converted to all three religions, at the same time. Apparently, a bicker broke out between three priests, and when they interrogate, essentially, which religion Pi was really into, Pi, innocently, said:&#8221;I just want to love god!&#8221; Three priests smiled, unnaturally, and turned away. I just couldn&#8217;t stop laughing reading this piece, which was somewhat intentionally sarcastic? More related revealing are probably coming in the next half, so next time.
