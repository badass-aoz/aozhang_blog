Washington Pass is my favorite alpine playground in the Washington State. Aside from the most famous Liberty Bell group, it also hosts some of the less visited climbs. Paisano Pinnacle (West Ridge)-Burgundy Spire (North Face) linkup from the Wine Spires range stood out because it&#8217;s moderate yet long (12 pitches). I&#8217;ve been eyeing this climb for years, and finally got a chance to climb it with three other friends (Qiang, Li and John) this year.

Before you dive in here, in case it&#8217;s helpful, as a collective effort we grouped resources found online into [this Google Doc][1]. If that infringes upon your copyright, please let me know.

## Sept 12, 2024 (Thursday) Approach {.wp-block-heading}

We reached the trailhead early in the afternoon. [The trailhead is a pullout][2] a few miles east of the Blue Lake Trailhead.

Starting from the trailhead, we scrambled down a steep boulder field going downhill. Once at the bottom, we merged back onto the trail based on a GPX track, followed along a flat trail and crossed Early Winters Creek.<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">

Afterwards the trail quickly arose into a dirty steep trail. My watch logged a 2k ft gain over 1 mile. Fortunately the day was pretty chilly with a bit of drizzling, so we weren’t sweating too much.<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">

We dropped our overnight gears at the Bench Camp (around 6.4K ft) and filtered water. There was another huge party bailing from the Silver Star Mountain due to weather. After some chitchats, three of us then went up to carry gears to the base of the climb to scout the approach so we could save some time and energy the day after.

The overall approach was dirty and required scrambling on loose dirt and rocks to cross the gulley. Thanks to [this Mountain Project post][3], we found the climbing base without too much efforts. It took us about an hour and half going up, but we did get lost, so we reserved about an hour for the approach the next day. <figure class="wp-block-image size-large">

It was late in climbing season. We didn’t find a good spot for water on the approach, so we decided to carry up enough water (2L for me) from Bench Camp the next day.<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">

## Sept 13, 2024 (Friday) Climb + Deproach {.wp-block-heading}

We woke up at 4:30am, started on trail at 5:00am and hit the climbing base at 6:00am. By the time we racked up and set hands on the freezing rock, the dawn broke. We formed two rope teams, and I started off leading the first one with Li. The Paisano Pinnacle West Ridge is usually climbed in 8 pitches, and can be linked up to the 3rd pitch of Burgundy Spire North Face. That would make the whole trip to be a 12-pitch linkup. Qiang and I led up all pitches. <figure class="wp-block-image size-large">

<img decoding="async" src="http://wp.docker.localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/img_5950-1.jpg?w=768" alt="" class="wp-image-1695" /> <figcaption class="wp-element-caption">about 200 ft below the climbing base. It was still dark.</figcaption></figure> 

The first few pitches were unremarkable. Most of them felt straightforward, consisting of slabby climbs and bushwacking. Rope drag was the biggest issue throughout the whole climb. I placed sparse protections in order to reduce friction and save time. 

After the cracks crux at pitch 4, I traversed left from the ridge. There were a few downclimbing moves involved. At pitch 5, there were several options. We chose the middle 5.8 one, which a guidebook accurately depicted it as “funky”.<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">

I probably have lost my way somewhere along the “actual” pitch 6 and 7. I ended up using all my 70m rope, introduced a humongous rope drag that forced me to belay with a tibloc (otherwise it was impossible to pull in the rope). After I got my 2nd at the belay station, I set out to find the “actual” pitch 7, the twin cracks. All I saw was a ledge with some dirty rocks going up to…the summit? I tried climbing up a few options, but half way up all I saw were low angle slabs and nothing protruding higher beyond that. Hell, isn&#8217;t there supposed to be another two pitches ahead? I ended up down-climbing both options. Qiang rapped to climber&#8217;s left and saw some kind of “twin cracks”. While our topo mentioned &#8220;twin cracks&#8221;, they were supposed to be on climber&#8217;s right! We were all befuddled but climbed up the cracks anyway.<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">

It still went, probably at 5.8.</figcaption></figure> 

Boom! The summit! I was more confused than happy. Where the hell did I get lost?<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">

It was around 12pm. We coiled up our rope and started descending to the sandy ledge connecting to Burgundy Spire. The transit required a short rappel. <figure class="wp-block-image size-large">

<img decoding="async" src="http://wp.docker.localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/img_5958-1.jpg?w=768" alt="" class="wp-image-1709" /> <figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The team were scrambling down and rappelling to the sandy ledge</figcaption></figure> 

Due to the drizzle and the overall gloomy weather the day before, John was suspecting the wall of North Face to be wet. It turned out perfectly okay.

Qiang and Li led up the 3rd pitch while John and I roped up as the second rope team and followed. The 3rd pitch itself was a low angle slab with plenty of handholds, bordering between low 5 and class 4 scrambling. For the whole 180’ pitch, I placed one single pro. For the 4th pitch, it was tempting to go left, but Qiang did that and had to climb around a very loose flake that would easily smash all of us if dislodged, so I ended up trending right and pulled up a different corner/flake, which turned out way easier than it seemed. The same style of climb persisted—lots of variations, just pick your poison.<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">

After pitch 4, we walked rightwards until we saw a piton, climbed up the piton and walked for around another 100 ft until we couldn&#8217;t go right anymore. We cross a tunnel during the transition.<figure class="wp-block-image">

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1536" height="2048" src="http://wp.docker.localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-1.jpeg" alt="May be an image of climbing and mountain" class="wp-image-1719" srcset="http://wp.docker.localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-1.jpeg 1536w, http://wp.docker.localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-1-225x300.jpeg 225w, http://wp.docker.localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-1-768x1024.jpeg 768w, http://wp.docker.localhost:8000/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-1-1152x1536.jpeg 1152w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1536px) 100vw, 1536px" /> <figcaption class="wp-element-caption">the tunnel crossing</figcaption></figure> 

Looking up the face, we saw many different variations here. The most common variation featured a chimney. That variation passed along several rappel anchors. However, we picked the rightmost (climber’s right) route, which involved a few stemming moves, a finger crack and an offwidth. I tried cheating a bit at the finger crack because none of the finger jam felt secure and they were too small to take any of my cam or my fingers. I inserted a small DMM Peanut and tried to pull on it. Before I congratulated my craftiness, the nut blew and thankfully I landed on my feet. It turned out that there were nice holds on the face to the left of the crack. Those holds worked perfectly, despite lacking good protections. The last offwidth pitch required climbing around a corner, jamming with right elbow and knee, and a lot of awkward movements (just like other offwidth climbs). A #4 C4 camalot protected really well at the start of that pitch. Once up the offwidth, I needed to traverse left along the summit ridge to reach to summit and my belay station. Hence a long extending protection (I extended a double length sling) was critical to reduce drag here.<figure class="wp-block-image">

When we were at the summit, it was already 4:30pm in the late afternoon. The other rope team (Qiang & Li) had descended past the first 3 rappels (both rope teams have 70m ropes). Meanwhile we found the rappel anchor right off the summit, and started going down too. The first rappel passed an intermediate station at about 25m down. We didn’t stop there and instead kept rappelling down to the anchor afterwards. <figure class="wp-block-image">

Doing saddle rappel to avoid potential shenanigans. </figcaption></figure> 

On the second rappel, we spot a stuck rope on our way down. We prayed hard for not getting our rope stuck. To our utter dismay, Murphy&#8217;s Law manifested itself. After we pulled the rope through the anchor, it got caught while falling off. Applying both John’s and my body weight didn&#8217;t make the rope budge an inch. To make matters worse, the wind and mist started rolling in. The other rope team Qiang and Li had already rappelled way lower so they weren&#8217;t able to help us. The sun was already below the horizon and it’s getting dark. We didn’t have much time to lose.

“Fuck it. I’ll rope ascend this.” I was infuriated.

A proper rope ascent requires one end of a rope to be securely fixed. That&#8217;s too much of an luxury for us, given we didn&#8217;t know how the rope was stuck. If that rope got unstuck while I was ascending it, I’d fall hundreds of feet down to meet my end. As such, I attached myself to the rope via a tibloc, and largely was climbing rocks instead of ascending the rope. There were a few committing moves that demanded me weighing the rope, but I was able to leave the rope unweighted most of the time.

I soon got up and saw how the rope was tangled. _Hauntingly precarious_. The rope fell through a horn, and one single thin 8.7mm strand was just squeezed down in the back of the horn. It took a single upward pull to untangle it. Glad that I didn&#8217;t weigh the rope much! I sacrificed a #2 c4 camalot and a nut as a backup, slung through both as my retreat anchor and asked for a lower. 

The cam made nerve-racking noises and walked slightly during lowering. 0/10. Would not recommend.

We got down to the sandy ledge and coiled up the rope. From here, we’d need to walk back towards the rock tunnel. We stayed high (didn’t down climb to the piton) and when we couldn’t walk any more, we found a rappel anchor to our left, at the edge of a cliff. Two more rappels from there got us to the sandy ledge that connected Burgundy Spire and summit of Paisano Pinnacle. We almost got our rope stuck there too.

At this moment it was getting dark, misty and windy, and the drizzle started. The visibility was limited. Thanks Qiang and Li (who had already got down from the climb), I was able to spot the next rappel anchor after descending the sandy ledge and walking to a corner to skier&#8217;s right. As I waited for John to come by, it became pitch dark. There were 3 more rappels awaiting us in the gulley. Notably the second last rappel was a rope stretcher for our 70m. We had to get off the rappel and down climb for another meter to reach the final rappel anchor.

Once we got to the bottom, and it’d be another two hours navigating out of the mystic terrain and down to the Bench Camp in the rain. And a few more hours to go back to the trailhead. Qiang and Li were waiting for us in the car at the trailhead. When John finally reached the car, it was about 3:30am in the morning.

&#8220;It&#8217;s called alpine end.&#8221; Dubbed Li.
