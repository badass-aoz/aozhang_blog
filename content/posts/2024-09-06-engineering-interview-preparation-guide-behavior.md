## Disclaimer {.wp-block-heading}

This post is based entirely on my understanding of what makes an ideal candidate. Different companies will have their own definitions and consequently questions. For example, a classic behavioral question is:

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
  <p>
    Why do you want to work at <company name>?
  </p>
</blockquote>

I’ve used this question in some of my early interviews, but I don’t think it yielded great results. The main issue is that it prompts candidates to focus too much on the company they’re applying to (e.g., “<company name> is a world leader in industry X”) rather than on themselves (e.g., “I’ve done A, B, and C, which are exactly what you need”). Another classic question I’m not fond of is:

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
  <p>
    Where do you see yourself in the next 5 years?
  </p>
</blockquote>

This question is too forward-looking, which isn’t ideal in an interview setting. I believe it&#8217;s better to predict the future based on what someone has done in the past, rather than what they come up with on the spot.

So, dear reader, please take my post with a grain of salt.

## Overview {.wp-block-heading}

While there are countless guides online on how to handle behavioral questions, I’ll just share what I learned after conducting close to 100 behavior interviews. The essence of a behavioral interview is to assess whether the candidate (“TC”) is a good cultural fit for the company. That’s why it’s important to understand the work culture of the companies you’re targeting. Here are some examples from major corporations:

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    Meta: Move Fast, Focus on Long-Term Impact
  </li>
  <li>
    Amazon: Customer Obsession, Ownership, Bias for Action, and Have Backbone (ever heard of <a href="https://www.amazon.jobs/content/en/our-workplace/leadership-principles">Leadership Principles</a>?)
  </li>
  <li>
    Google: Prioritization, Project Leadership
  </li>
  <li>
    Microsoft: Growth Mindset, Collaboration, and Teamwork
  </li>
</ul>

You should be able to easily find information about a company&#8217;s work culture online, or you can always ask the recruiter how to best prepare for the interviews. What matters most during the interview is understanding what your interviewer is asking about. The following framework should be generic enough for most large companies:

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    Scope: <ul class="wp-block-list">
      <li>
        What scope of projects has TC handled before? This can usually be assessed based on the technical complexity of the projects, the complexity of collaboration dynamics, the length of time, contributors involved, impact, etc.
      </li>
      <li>
        Some companies also ask the interviewer to assess TC’s level during behavioral interviews based on this aspect. As a result, the interviewer may make recommendations like “not a hire for the target level, but hire for one level below.”
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    Motivation: <ul class="wp-block-list">
      <li>
        What does TC want? Can TC back up their claims with examples? What keeps TC motivated?
      </li>
      <li>
        I don’t see the pursuit of a high pay grade as a bad thing, but I also want to see some motivation beyond that.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    Growth: <ul class="wp-block-list">
      <li>
        Does TC have a growth mindset?
      </li>
      <li>
        This tends to play a bigger role in the assessment of junior candidates than senior ones (not that it’s unimportant for seniors), as junior candidates usually have less experience and are expected to grow quickly.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    Empathy: <ul class="wp-block-list">
      <li>
        Does TC think from others&#8217; perspectives? Will they be reasonable collaborators if hired? Is TC assuming good intent?
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    Introspection: <ul class="wp-block-list">
      <li>
        Does TC understand how they’re perceived? Do they know their own strengths and weaknesses?
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    Proactiveness: <ul class="wp-block-list">
      <li>
        Can TC take on responsibilities necessary for the business, even if they fall outside of TC’s regular job duties?
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    Perseverance: <ul class="wp-block-list">
      <li>
        When needed, can TC push through difficulties and get things done?
      </li>
      <li>
        I emphasize this much more in a startup environment, where the stake is much higher than in a large corporation.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    Conflict Resolution: <ul class="wp-block-list">
      <li>
        Does TC have experience handling conflicts at various levels? Are they resourceful enough to navigate those situations?
      </li>
      <li>
        I don’t expect this as much from junior candidates, but it can be a differentiator for senior candidates, as they are expected to lead projects in dynamic settings, which often requires navigating difficult situations.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    Communication: <ul class="wp-block-list">
      <li>
        Is TC concise and to the point?
      </li>
      <li>
        I usually don’t use a separate question to assess TC’s communication skill, because this skill should come apparent from other questions.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

## Tips: {.wp-block-heading}

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    Be concise: Focus on what the interviewer is asking and address it directly. Share only the key context, and offer more details if needed. Avoid giving too much information upfront.
  </li>
  <li>
    Set up the situation quickly: Practice explaining the situation briefly (in 30 seconds) to give the interviewer time to gather insights. If they don’t know where you&#8217;re headed, they can’t help you.
  </li>
  <li>
    Keep small talk short: Interviewers may start with warm-up questions like “Can you tell me about yourself?” Keep your answers brief, as these questions are often just icebreakers.
  </li>
  <li>
    Don’t worry if the interviewer cuts you off. It could mean they’ve collected sufficient signals on a topic and/or that your answer is too long. If unsure, pause and ask if you&#8217;re on the right track.
  </li>
  <li>
    Focus on recent experience: Senior candidates should highlight the past 5 years. Early-career examples won’t provide useful insights.
  </li>
  <li>
    Highlight what you&#8217;ve done, not what you plan to do: Past accomplishments are more valuable in interviews than promises for the future, especially for experienced candidates.
  </li>
  <li>
    Be conversational: Guide the conversation to showcase your strengths but allow the interviewer space to ask questions. Avoid dominating the discussion; leave room for a natural back-and-forth.
  </li>
  <li>
    Be authentic: be true to yourself. Give the signal that the interviewer is looking for, but don’t lie.
  </li>
</ul>

## A close look into some examples: {.wp-block-heading}

Here are some of my favorite questions that have provided great insights to interviewers. Unlike technical interviews, there’s no “right” or “perfect” answer here.



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
  <p>
    Tell me about your most successful project. Why was it successful?
  </p>
</blockquote>

**Probes: \[Motivation\] \[Scope\]**

This question helps assess TC’s motivation and scope. It also reveals whether they set clear milestones and metrics to measure progress in their projects.

It allows for several follow-up questions, such as:

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    What were the biggest challenges? <strong>[Perseverance]</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    What didn’t work as expected, and how did you fix it? <strong>[Introspection]</strong>
  </li>
</ul>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
  <p>
    We all have weaknesses. What are yours, and how are you improving them?
  </p>
</blockquote>

**Probes: \[Introspection\] \[Growth\]**

This question shows whether TC is aware of their weaknesses and has a plan to improve (and if they are improving). It’s usually clear if they’ve thought about this before or are making up an answer on the spot.

Junior candidates often mention technical skills (e.g. exploitation, reverse engineering, etc.) they want to learn, while senior candidates tend to focus on more strategic aspects. For example, I’ve heard EM candidates talking about fostering team culture or managing cross-team dynamics.

**Red Flag:**

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    Making up answers on the spot.
  </li>
</ul>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
  <p>
    Tell me about a person you had difficulty dealing with.
  </p>
</blockquote>

**Probes: \[Conflict Resolution\] \[Empathy\]**

I’ve heard answers varying greatly, but here are some key red flags to watch for:

**Red Flags:**

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    Candidates with 3+ years of experience can’t think of an example. This usually implies some bigger issues.
  </li>
  <li>
    TC blames the other person entirely without trying to understand their perspective, showing a lack of empathy.
  </li>
  <li>
    TC escalates issues immediately without trying to resolve them first. This also points to a lack of empathy.
  </li>
  <li>
    TC avoids escalation when it’s needed. While situational, not knowing when to escalate can indicate a deeper issue.
  </li>
</ul>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
  <p>
    Tell me about a disagreement you had with a colleague/manager, and it turned out you were wrong.
  </p>
</blockquote>

**Probes: \[Introspection\] \[Conflict Resolution\]**

This question has mixed results. Sometimes candidates struggle to think of an example. In that case, I ask them to ignore the &#8220;turned out you were wrong&#8221; part.

**Red Flag:**

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    The disagreement was resolved by Googling. Not a <em>red flag</em>, but this example doesn’t offer useful signals.
  </li>
</ul>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
  <p>
    Tell me about a time when a project fell behind schedule.
  </p>
</blockquote>

**Probes: \[Perseverance\] \[Introspection\]**

I expect TC to explain what happened, why it happened, and how they used creativity or persistence or external help or something else to complete the project. A strong candidate should also reflect on why the delay occurred and what they’ve done to prevent future delays.

**Red Flags:**

<ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>
    TC failed to provide an example: Come on, we engineers aren’t great at project planning.
  </li>
  <li>
    TC failed to understand why the project fell behind or how to avoid it in the future.
  </li>
</ul>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
  <p>
    Why are you leaving your current job?
  </p>
</blockquote>

**Probes: [Motivation]**

I usually don’t ask this question unless something unusual stands out on TC’s resume, notably, if they had stayed at their current job for less than a year, or if there’s a general pattern of not staying long at jobs. I wouldn’t ding TC for being laid off, because lots of time this is out of TC’s control, though I’d try digging a layer deeper to understand if there’s a underlying reason worth noting.

Once, one candidate mentioned a fight with their boss, and I couldn’t wait to hear more. 😈 Other times, candidates might seem to be hiding something, and I’d pick up on that.



## Other example questions to consider: {.wp-block-heading}

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
  <p>
    Tell me about a time you were given feedback that was constructive
  </p>
</blockquote>

**\[Introspection\]\[Growth\]**



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
  <p>
    Tell me about a time you had to step up and take responsibility for others
  </p>
</blockquote>

**[Proactiveness]**



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
  <p>
    Tell me about your favorite day at work
  </p>
</blockquote>

**[Motivation]**



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
  <p>
    Tell me about something you change that’s typically outside of your job responsibilities
  </p>
</blockquote>

**[Proactiveness]**



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
  <p>
    Tell me about a time when you had to come up with a creative solution to solve a problem.
  </p>
</blockquote>
