I found this video very informational. tl;dr: lactose were not removed from the milk. Actually lactase got added, which decomposed the lactose into glucose and galactose. Those two were significantly sweeter than lactose, hence why.<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-rich wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio">
